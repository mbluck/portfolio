## Selected Academic Works
#### Predicting Student Dropouts in Higher Education
Compares the accuracy and computational efficiency of different machine learning classification models for predicting which students would drop out of university, including logistic regression, SVM, and random foresting. Discusses the affects of using different matrix decomposition and convergence methods on algorithm efficiency. Constructs a model that predicts whether a student will drop out with 88% accuracy and optimal efficiency using logistic regression with gradient descent. <br>

## Works in Progress

### Housing Location Analysis: [Repo Link](https://github.com/mbluck/Housing-Location-Analysis)
An analysis of the effect that a house's proximity to other locations of interest (parks, schools, etc.) has on its price. Data obtained through webscraping and geocoding API, and analyzed via regression.

### Stocks by Sector Dashboard:   [Repo Link](https://github.com/mbluck/Stocks-by-Sector-Analysis)
An interactive dashboard web app built with Plotly Dash that displays real-time stock data aggregated across sectors.

### Marilyn Monroe: [Repo Link](https://github.com/mbluck/Shot-Marilyn)
A web app built with Streamlit for a data-based interpretation of Andy Warhol's "Shot Marilyn" using the color data of the images.
